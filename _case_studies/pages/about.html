    content_markdown: Static sites are just HTML, CSS and JavaScript files. This means they're faster to build, require less technical knowledge, need less upkeep and are future proofed.
  - title: Scalability
    icon: trending_up
    content_markdown: A single webserver can handle [a lot](http://www.speedemy.com/apache-vs-nginx-2015/) of traffic if it's only serving static content.
  - title: Speed
    content_markdown: With static there's no database queries or page to generate on-the-fly. All the web server needs to do is return a static file.

  - title: Security
    content_markdown: A static site is as secure as the web server its running on which makes them significantly less vunerable to hackers.

	<h1>CloudCannon is a new kind of CMS for the static site generator, Jekyll.</h1>

	<h2>What drives us</h2>
	<p>Our mission is to bring all the advantages of static technology to developers while giving editors intuitive interfaces and workflows to update content. We believe most informational websites should be static. The reason theyâ€™re not is non-technical editors need to update content.</p>
