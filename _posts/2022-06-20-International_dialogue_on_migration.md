Youth exchange “International dialogue on Migration” took place in Rustavi, Georgia. International dialogue on Migration is a two-stage Erasmus+ project working on the topic of migration which brings together participants from Latvia, Spain, Czech Republic, Italy, Greece, Turkey, Poland and Georgia.

	
ICPI hosted the second stage in Rustavi from 20 - 27 June 2022. The YE has brought together 42 participants and aims to create space for youth to explore the role of international organizations and governmental bodies in the migration management process, their policies towards migrants, refugees and IDPs through non-formal education.


Our participants had a chance to meet with youngsters from the Youth House ახალგაზრდული სახლი - წეროვანი in Tserovani IDP settlement. Together they organized a “Human Library” activity in which the international as well as the Georgian youngsters shared personal stories with each other regarding their experiences with migration. Thank you very much for hosting us and sharing experiences.
