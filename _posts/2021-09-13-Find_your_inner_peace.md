Our Erasmus+ project “Find your Inner Peace”, which took place from 13-22 September 2021, has come to an end. For 10 days we united together 35 young people from Italy, Armenia, Spain, Russia, Portugal, Ukraine and Georgia in Bakuriani, Georgia to discover different practices enhancing our self-awareness and finding inner peace. 


We explored different types of yoga and meditation, connected without talking through contact exercises, created (and destroyed) mandala’s together, opened up and shared emotions during our personal development sessions and we hiked all the way to the mountaintop to enjoy the amazing surroundings. 


During the evenings we learned more about all the teams’ cultures, accompanied by local foods, dances and having fun, or we would gather around the camp fire improving our vocal skills by singing songs together. 


After our last activity the universe even blessed us with little soft pearls of rain falling down while the sunset covered us in a warm glow of gold. Everything seemed to come together in this magical moment of shared happiness and gratefulness.
