Our youth exchange "Follow the Rainbow" took place in Bakuriani, Georgia from 5-13th of November and brought together 40 participants from Spain, Belgium, Ukraine, Turkey, Latvia, Italy and Georgia. During the youth exchange, the participants developed gender sensitive skills and further knowledge about gender issues, human rights, sexual health, activism and the situation on the LGBTQ+ community in other countries. The project created a safe, inclusive space where young people could feel comfortable enough to open up about their sexuality, and explore, discover and learn in a non-formal way together, while given the opportunity to connect to others and share personal experiences.


The participants created their own magazine. Follow the Rainbow Zine!
