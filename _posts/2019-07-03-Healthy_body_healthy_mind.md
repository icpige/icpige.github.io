"Healthy Body for a Healthy Mind" was an international training course, approved by Belgium National agency through Erasmus + program, together with the coordinator organization from Belgium JOETZ vzw and hosting organization International Center for Peace and Integration - ICPI From Georgia the project was implemented during 3-14 of July in Racha, Georgia. The project brought together 27 youth workers from Belgium, Georgia, Italy, Azerbajian, Latvia, Austria, Romania and Spain.


The idea behind the project was to properly introduce and examine the importance of leading an active and healthy lifestyle for the benefit not only of the body but also for the mind. It was very important for the integrity of the project to achieve good balance between theoretical learning and practical activities: the fortune of this outcome was mostly due to the heterogeneous group of participants who attended the project.
 

Organizers were very attentive on the selection process so it was possible not only to have participants with good experience in outdoor activities and/or healthy related subjects but as well less experienced or completely newcomers to the ideas and objectives of the project.      Thanks to this mixed team a solid bond was easily created between participants who were eager to learn and teach. A fundamental aspect of this outdoor project was the participation, on the first half of the activity, of Guest speakers from the Georgia Red Cross Society who gave a tailored workshop on first aid and other safety thematic specially for those who practice hiking and camping, or were willing to start practicing this activities more often.
 

The underlined importance of this project was not only to set the basics for approaching and disseminate a lifestyle that benefits the body and mind which also goes hand in hand with the respect of our environment, with a positive attitude towards people from distant and different cultural backgrounds, but above all, ideal to contribute to a better perception on the outdoors and to learn that difficult and non comfortable situations can have a good influence in the way we treat ourselves and others.
