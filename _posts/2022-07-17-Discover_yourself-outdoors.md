The second stage of the Erasmus+ project “Discover Yourself Outdoors” has come to an end. From 17-29th of July we brought together 29 participants from Spain, Czech Republic, Latvia, Romania and Georgia.

 We spent almost two weeks together on the campsite in Utsera (Georgia), learning new skills, sharing information, building fires, sleeping in tents, playing volley-ball and badminton, singing karaoke and praying for sunshine to be able to go on hikes. The training course aimed to prepare youth workers to be able to coach and activate the youth society they work with through engagement in outdoor and sport activities, using the knowledge and tools from this training based on non-formal education principles. As the first stage was based on experiencing different outdoor activities focused on self-development and getting a deeper knowledge of themselves; the second stage dived deeper in strengthening their competences and skills in organizing outdoor and team building activities for the youth they work with as well as experiencing hiking and camping as outdoor education methodologies.
