The on-arrival training was held in Misaksieli, Georgia, between November, 12th and 16th. It brought together 24 volunteers, came from Poland, Germany, England, Denmark, Latvia and France, who are doing their EVS in Georgia and Armenia. Suzon, new volunteer in ICPI, took part in this training. The main objective of the On-arrival Training was to introduce the volunteers to the host country, preparing them for the service period and the EVS experience. It also helped the volunteers to adapt to cultural and personal challenges, and allowed them to get to know each other and to build a network. Volunteers also received guidance on conflict prevention and crisis management. Besides, the training was a time for them to plan the coming months and to develop their own personal goals for their period of service, in line with the non-formal learning philosophy of EVS. During the meeting, volounteers had the chance to share what their project is about with the other ones. As there is a lot of similarities between the different projects – for exemple, Suzon has to give english classes, organize events for the social bar Generator 9.8, and help to prepare Erasmus + projects – volunteers could easily exchange some advices and feelings about their tasks. During the training, exercises were provided in combination with games, energizers, role-playing… Each activity was run by 2 professional trainers, from Georgia and Armenia. During the workshops, the participants also had the chance to visit Tbilisi, Georgia’s capital, and be invited to a Supra, a traditional Georgian feast and important part of Georgian social culture.
