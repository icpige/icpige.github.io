 The first stage of Training Course “I am - We are” took place in the snow-covered landscape of Bakuriani, Georgia from 14 - 22 March and brought together 27 youth workers from Portugal, Spain, Belgium, Italy, Poland, Romania, Greece and Georgia. This first part of the training was mainly focused on strengthening the youth workers’ personal growth and competences through methods of personal development (I am) and on growing their skills in empathic communication, conflict transformation and creating connection. Throughout these 9 days the participants discovered and learned practical tools and theoretical knowledge that they can first of all imply in their own personal lives, and secondly will show its fruitfulness in their social work and engagement with youngsters.

	
During the project participants also made a study visit to IDP Women Association "Consent" in Gori, Georgia. The organization was founded in 1995 by IDP women from Abkhazia region and since then they have been helping their community. Here the participants had an opportunity to be involved in an interactive activity - “Living Library” - which created a space for sharing experiences and knowledge.
