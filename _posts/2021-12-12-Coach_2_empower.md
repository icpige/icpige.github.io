The international training course "Coach to Empower" was successfully carried out! 30 participants from Latvia and Georgia met to learn about the basics of coaching and practice with each other in interactive coaching sessions.

	
The project took place in Bakuriani (Georgia) between the 12th and the 20th of December 2021.

It aimed at equipping youth workers with coaching skills that they can use first of all in their personal life, and secondly to improve their social work and engagement with others. This aim was successfully achieved: the youth workers developed new knowledge and skills in empathic communication and coaching.
