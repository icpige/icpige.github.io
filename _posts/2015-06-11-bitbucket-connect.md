Today we're bringing a new level of simplicity to managing [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) websites with the CloudCannon add-on for Bitbucket Connect.

At the press of a button, Bitbucket users can turn a repository with a Jekyll site into a live website with a beautiful content management system.

The workflow is completely seamless. All changes between CloudCannon and Bitbucket are kept in sync so you can always pull a production copy of the site to your local machine.

Now your development and marketing teams can collaborate and work together in ways that have never been possible.

#### How do you install it?

Login to [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) and go to [Find new add-ons](https://bitbucket.org/account/addon-directory/). Click Install next to CloudCannon.

Go to your Jekyll site repository in Bitbucket. There's now a CloudCannon button on the sidebar.

CloudCannon syncs all your files from BitBucket.

Open up an `.html` file, go to the Code Editor and add `class="editable"` to elements you want to be updated.

Save that. Now when you go the Visual Editor those elements will have yellow boxes around them indicating they can be edited.

CloudCannon also makes editing Front Matter simple for non-technical users:
