“Power Of Change” is a two-stages ERASMUS+ project. First stage was held in Bakuriani, Georgia, between 12-19 October of 2018 year. 31 participants has taken part in this project from 7 countries &nbsp;(Georgia, Armenia, Spain, Poland, Italy, Germany, Greece, Romania).

The main aim of the project was to giving tools for the participants for working on personal development, giving instruments for empathic communication, aiming at improving peace-building attitudes and skills through the self development process. Help them to access their skills and qualities, consider their aims in life and set goals in order to realize and maximize their potential. Sunny weather of Bakuriani gave a chance to organizers and participants to implement most of the activities in the&nbsp; nature which helped them to be more open &nbsp;to express their emotion better and &nbsp;meanwhile enjoy the colors of nature. &nbsp;

It was very interesting and life changing&nbsp; project for each participant indeed, with interesting activities, interesting people and their stories behind.
