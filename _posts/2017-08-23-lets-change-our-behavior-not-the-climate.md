International Training “Let’s Change our Behavior, not the Climate”, organized by French non-governmental association AMSED, was held in Strasbourg, France, on August 12-21, 2017.&nbsp;<br>Project included 10 days of intensive training sessions, field activities, meetings and works in smaller groups. There were 29 participants from 12 different countries: Romania, Turkey, Georgia, Ukraine, Italy, Spain, Morocco, Tunisia, France, Algeria, Sweden and Bulgaria. The aim of the training was to raise awareness about Climate Change and Global Warming; to exchange good practices and ways in which different countries tackle this issue; to find new partners and friends and make steps towards right direction in order to solve problems concerning Climate Change and Environmental Protection. Participants developed skills, attitudes and knowledge not only concerning Climate Change, but also learned the basic principles of managing a project. Towards the end of the seminar, each of the participant had the opportunity to receive his/her personal Youthpass.&nbsp;<br>Following Participants from ICPI, Georgia were attending the projects: Elene Gachechiladze, Nana Meparishvili and Lana Adamyan. This training surely was a valuable experience for them. They learned about the existing situation concerning Climate Change and worked on the possible solutions for different problems in international subgroups. One of the most important tasks they had was to think of the ecofriendly recommendations for private as well as governmental sectors. The participants also had the opportunity to meet local experts and have discussions with them on various topics (the causes and effects of Global Warming; Women and Climate Change, etc.). One of the Field trips included visit of the Agorae (student social grocery) and the Permaculture Garden in Strasbourg where participants deepened their understanding and appreciation of bio products.<br>The training course was very interesting and productive. Thanks to organizers for that!
