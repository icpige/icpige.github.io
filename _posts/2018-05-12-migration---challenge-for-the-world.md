"Migration - Challenge for the World" was two stages Erasmus+ project aiming cover, explore, discuss and deal with integration related challenges linked to the migration process. Creating network of the civic organizations working or willing to work in the field, promote new tools and methodology among youth workers and NGO workers in order to strengthen the integration and peace building process in the global community.

The need to organize project about the topic was caused due to the fact that generally migration related challenges are the driving policy issues in the contemporary Europe. The main aim of the project was to bring positive change and support the implementation of the European Policy Agenda for the growth, peace building, integration and social inclusion via non-formal education."
