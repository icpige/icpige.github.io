After six months of incredible experience with Ana Virsaladze, intern of ICPI, we want to thank her for this interesting journey and congrats with a successful, exciting and memorable work. Ana joined our team within  ICPI and International Black Sea University (IBSU) joint internship program, and succeeded in every way possible. Thanks to IBSU for the meaningful cooperation.

Special thanks to Ana for her hard work, dedication and motivation. ICPI team wishes you the best in the next phases of your career.

Here’s what Ana says about her journey:

"I undertook a six-month internship in the International Centre for Peace and Integration (ICPI). During this period the organization supported me in both my professional and personal development. My responsibilities among others included working on Erasmus+ projects, communicating with partners and participants, working with documents. This might sound a little bit monotonous, but working on projects based on interesting themes, constantly meeting new people, stress and tension-free working environment, friendly and welcoming ICPI staff made my work interesting and enjoyable. During my internship I was involved in implementation of several projects and also participated in several projects which were interesting for me. Thanks to all of these, I developed certain skills such as writing projects, communication skills, time management, etc. Participating in projects enabled me to gain knowledge on concrete topics like informal education, youth empowerment and possibilities for young people to develop, migration, formulation of public opinion, enabled me to get to know diverse people and cultures.

After my internship in ICPI I was clearly noticing positive changes in myself. ICPI also gave me a chance to stay involved even after conclusion of internship, gave me chances to participate in and implement interesting events and projects. "
