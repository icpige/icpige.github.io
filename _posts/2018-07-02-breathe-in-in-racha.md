International Training Course „Breathe in”- was implemented in Racha, Georgia from 18th till 30th of June ,2018. “Mosta Y.E.C.” from Malta and “International Centre for Peace and Integration” from Georgia were official organizers of the project. And thanks to the emergence of social media as the increasingly dominant mode of information dissemination, we are glad to share the details of the project and our positive vision with wider society.

The project was divided in two stages. First part was held in Mosta, Malta where participants took the theoretical knowledge. During the second stage participants had a chance to camp and hike in Racha region and use the theoretical knowledge in practice.

"Breathe in" was Erasmus + project aiming to promote a healthy lifestyle among youth workers, trainers and leaders coming from the EU and EECA region. The program aimed to foster youth workers’ competencies in planning and implementing outdoor activities related to good practices of a healthy lifestyle.

The training course was based on non-formal education principles and were prepared by qualified trainers, to share maximum of their experience in outdoor activity’s field, in order to help participants to use gained knowledge and practical skills in activities, which were held throughout the project.

The project gathered up 28 youngsters from Malta, Bulgaria, Spain, Italy, Ukraine, Portugal, Lebanon, Georgia.

During the project theoretical sessions participants learned about resources what nature provides, how to use and orientate in topographic map, how to calculate hiking distance and time, how to build and choose place for tent, how to pack backpacks, how to provide first aid treatment in the wild nature. &nbsp;Trainers were providing participants with many teambuilding activity’s in order to help participants get to know each other and make stronger connections between them. Activity’s like living library, Erasmus + informational session and cultural evenings gave participants opportunity to share their own life experience, learn about Erasmus + possibility’s and concept and get to know other cultures.&nbsp; Besides theoretical sessions and activity’s in the camping area participants went for 5 hikes (four 1-day hikes and one 2-day hikes) Hiking was guided by qualified hikers and participants learned about hiking technique, group dynamics, obstacles and of course enjoyed astonishing landscapes. &nbsp;
