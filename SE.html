      <h3>Social Entrepreneurship</h3>
      <p>
       The concept of social entrepreneurship is an innovative way to solve social problems as it offers to enter the labor market and the public sphere at the same time. Social Enterprises using their profit to solve social, cultural, or environmental issues. This concept may be applied to a variety of organizations of different sizes, aims, and beliefs, including youth organizations, which we are more focused on in our projects.

Main aims and objectives are:
<ul>
 	<li>To promote concepts and tools for the development of social entrepreneurship to a targeted demographic of youth because we believe that this is one of the possible answer to the present issue of employability of young people in the EU and neighbour countries.</li>
 	<li>To give a potential solution for the problem of financial sustainability that Youth NGOs around Europe and especially in non.EU countries have. NGOs don’t have to depend only on donors’ priorities and grants through social enterprises and can fully address local community needs.</li>
</ul>
Social entrepreneurship can be a response to these challenges, as it draws upon business techniques to raise additional sources of funding to find committed, possibly longer-term community-based solutions to local problems.

Project partners promote the concept of social entrepreneurship among their communities in order to develop it more in their own countries.
