      <h3> Collaborative Consumption and Social Economy</h3>
      <p>
The present economic situation of Europe has generated new discussions on the management of resources and the way in which each individual or entity use it. The new movement called “collaborative consumption (CC)” or “sharing economy” can find barter trade markets, car/bike/house sharing, co-working, crowdfunding, couchsurfing, peer to peer lending and renting, even virtual currencies. These new methodologies of sharing can improve the youth work projects and meet the needs that the actual economic situation has created.

The aims and objectives of our projects are:
<ul>
 	<li>To break the pessimistic analyze  of the current situation, which leads young people to social exclusion, and presents itself as an opportunity to develop new attitudes, presenting social and business actions that can contribute the change, in time when these are extremely necessary.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>To give participants all the needed information and tools about CC so that they can apply and use them after the projects in their real lives.</li>
 	<li>To build networks in the context of social innovation under participants and youth workers to strengthening entrepreneurship.</li>
</ul>
The projects can help to tackle the challenges of managing resources by providing people with the skills required by the economy, while allowing them to play an active role in society and achieve personal fulfillment. The training is proving the investment in knowledge, skills and competences will benefit individuals, institutions, organizations and society as a whole by contributing to growth and ensuring equity, prosperity and social inclusion in Europe and beyond.
