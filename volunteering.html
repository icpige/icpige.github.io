      <h3>EVS</h3>
      <p>The European Voluntary Service (EVS) forms part of ERASMUS+, a European Union programme that promotes the mobility of young people through international activities with a non-formal education dimension such as youth exchanges, voluntary services, youth initiatives and training of youth workers. This activity allows young people aged 17-30 to express their personal commitment through unpaid and full-time voluntary service for up to 12 months in another country within or outside the European Union. Young volunteers are given the opportunity to contribute to the daily work of organizations dealing with youth information and policies, young people’s personal and socio-educational development, civic engagement, social care, inclusion of disadvantaged, environment, nonformal education programmes, ICTs and media literacy, culture and creativity, development cooperation, etc. Young people with fewer opportunities can receive additional support to enable their participation and would also be allowed to go on EVS for a shorter duration of time (from 2 weeks and up).

EVS opportunities are available in both Erasmus+ Programme countries and Neighbouring Partner countries, Programme countries include the member states of the European Union, the EFTA/EEA countries (Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway) and pre-accession countries. Some EVS projects can take place in partner regions of the European Union, including Eastern Europe and the Caucasus region. At least one of the countries involved in a project (either the sending country, where the volunteer is from, or the host country, where the volunteer is going) must be a programme country.

What costs does EVS cover for you as a volunteer?
<ul>
 	<li>Your international travel – EVS covers reasonable travel costs from your home to the host organization</li>
 	<li>Exceptional volunteer costs – any reasonable and justifiable costs related to the special needs of the volunteer (medical attendance, additional preparation, etc)</li>
 	<li>A volunteer’s allowance, fixed per host country, and paid in full to the host organisation to be given to the volunteer weekly or monthly</li>
 	<li>Your accommodation and food costs</li>
 	<li>Insurance – all volunteers are insured against sickness, accidents, permanent invalidity, and repatriation in case of serious illness, accident, and death. The insurance also covers civil liability.</li>
</ul>
<strong>How to apply?</strong>

You can apply to volunteer with the EVS directly through the organisation responsible for sending you abroad or receiving you in the host country and for arranging all practicalities.

The European Youth Portal, (http://europa.eu/youth/splash) the EU’s website for young people, hosts a database of volunteering opportunities http://europa.eu/youth/volunteering/project_en containing:
<ul>
 	<li>Details of different projects</li>
 	<li>Descriptions of what kind of volunteers are needed</li>
</ul>
Also: If you can’t find a suitable project, you can browse the list of EVS organisations (http://europa.eu/youth/volunteering/evs-organisation_en ) and get in touch with them to check if they are offering placements. Please bear in mind that some of those listed may not currently be looking for new volunteers.</p>
