<p>Lives@Screens (L@S) – youth project addressed to young as well as wannabe professionals in the field of documentary making. L@S aims at enhancing confidence building between Abkhazian and Georgian youth gathering because of a common personal and professional interest. L@S draws on the strategies of non-formal education and has adopted the learning by doing methodology of work. Participants cooperated in a regime of co-working that took place during three workshops in third countries and through on-line communication. Co-workers followed a basic school of film-making created on their needs and interests, and finally divided into two crews with the objective of envisioning, shooting, and editing a joint documentary film made of two different stories. Both documentaries present unique personages who have curious and unusual lives. By following a part of the heroes’ biographies, young directors show the places where they live through privileged perspectives connecting the past and future, tradition and innovation, problems and hope. Through both poetic and dramatic real images, genuine art as well as music, the viewers can discover something new about fascinating locations such as Sukhum/Sokhumi and Tbilisi, enjoying a positive wish for the future and for the young generation. L@S and the spreading of the film-documentary film want to be vehicles disseminating good practices of co-work and cross-divide encounters that can set a successful example to local and international societies on how young people are not simple promises for the future, as everybody says, but active protagonists of the present for the general improvement of human relationships at heart. And we do it through art and creativity, the main tools for striking the attention of a young, diverse, and wide public.</p></p>
